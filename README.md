This repository contains a short computer-assisted note and its full
verification package: two machine-verified upper bounds ("ceilings") for the
extremal value of the scoring rule of the EinsteinArena
"prime-number-theorem" benchmark board, a finitary Mertens-type extremal
problem. For each reach `K`, the board's value is

> ```
> S*(K) = max { -sum_{k=2..K} f(k)*ln(k)/k :
>               f in [-10,10]^{K-1},
>               sum_{k=2..K} f(k)*(floor(m/k) - m/k) <= 1.0001,  m = 1..10K-1 }.
> ```

The headline results:

> **Theorem (reach 4800).**
> ```
> S*(4800)  <=  0.9963688817172828744325041 .
> ```
>
> **Theorem (reach 12000).**
> ```
> S*(12000) <=  0.9974876103072528157057480 .
> ```

Each bound is a **weak-duality box certificate**: an explicit, entrywise
nonnegative dyadic-rational dual vector `y = Y / 2^48` whose certified value

```
B(y) = 1.0001 * sum_m y_m  +  10 * sum_{k=2..K} |r_k|  >=  S*(K),
r_k  = -(ln k)/k - N_k/(k * 2^48),   N_k = sum_m Y_m*(k*floor(m/k) - m),
```

is evaluated with **exact integer** residual accumulation (`N_k` in Python
big-ints via the `-(m mod k)` form, cross-checked against `k*floor(m/k)-m`)
and **outward-rounded interval enclosures** of every `ln(k)/k`
(`mpmath.iv`). No unenclosed floating-point scalar enters the certified
inequality; every transcendental quantity is an outward-rounded
high-precision interval, and the interval upper endpoint is extracted as an
exact rational directly from its mantissa/exponent tuple (never re-rounded
through `mpmath.mpf`). The log enclosures are themselves cross-audited two
ways — dual-precision nesting at 400 vs 800 bits over *every* `k`, and a
rational `atanh`-series bracket independent of any log oracle. An independent
skeptic harness (fresh residual pass by a different route, pure-`Fraction`
spot checks, SHA-256 hash pinning) passes all checks on both certificates.

## Plain-English framing

The board's constraint is a finite Mertens-type program: the Möbius function
is its infinite-reach extremal shadow (`μ` satisfies the constraint with
`E(m) ≡ 1` and objective `1`, both classical equivalents of the prime number
theorem), but no finite truncation of `μ` is feasible, so the arena's leading
constructions are sparse feasible surrogates that approach the ceiling from
below. The competition asks how high the honest score can climb; this note
supplies the matching **upper** bounds — proven, in exact arithmetic, at two
reaches — so that every reach-`K` construction's honest score is provably
capped by `S*(K)` for `K ∈ {4800, 12000}`.

## What this does *not* claim

Honest scoping is the point of the note, so it is worth repeating here:

- **Ceilings, not constructions.** These are one-sided *upper* bounds on
  `S*(K)`. They do not exhibit a construction achieving them, and they do not
  beat any leaderboard entry (the arena constructions sit below the ceiling by
  design).
- **No certified monotonicity.** The intuitive `S*(K') <= S*(K)` for
  `K' < K` is *measured* (LP optima `0.99350, 0.99637, 0.99746` at reaches
  `2400, 4800, 12000`), **not proven** here; certificates that invoke
  monotonicity across reaches would be heuristics, not lemmas. In particular
  the reach-4800 ceiling does **not** upper-bound `S*(48000)` (the live board
  reach): zero-extending its dual to the reach-48000 column set is valid but
  vacuous.
- **The larger reaches are pending.** A reach-24000 dual solve was still
  running at the time of writing, and a single-LP attempt at `K = 48000` did
  not converge within its time budget. Neither is certified here. See the
  pending-verification ledger (Section 7 of the note) for the full list of
  items not machine-verified.
- **Everything else is a measurement, labeled as such.** The near-optimality
  of the certificates (float LP optima `5.6e-7` / `2.7e-5` below the ceilings),
  the Möbius-truncation violations, the cardinality curves, and the agents'
  score ladders are floating-point measurements, not certified brackets, and
  are marked as measurements in the note.

## Reproduce it

Requires **Python ≥ 3.12** with **numpy** and **mpmath** (`pip install -r
requirements.txt`). Every certified path runs from these two packages plus the
standard library — no network, no GPU. `highspy`/HiGHS is used *only* in the
separate LP-solve stage that produced the duals and never touches the
verification. All commands run from the repository root.

```bash
make verify          # regenerate BOTH ceilings from duals/ + certs/;
                     # prints "ALL CEILINGS VERIFIED."
make verify-K4800    # reach-4800 ceiling only
make verify-K12000   # reach-12000 ceiling only
make versions        # print the exact tool versions in the certified path
```

Each `verify` target runs `scripts/recompute_bound.py` on the archived integer
dual (`duals/certified_dual_K*.npz`) plus its LP report and certificate JSON,
regenerates the exact weak-duality bound `B(y)` by an implementation
independent of the original certifier — its own big-integer residual pass, its
own 500- and 800-bit interval enclosures with a nesting check, and an
exact-rational vault inequality extracted directly from the interval mantissa —
and confirms the pinned 25-digit theorem decimal is a valid, tight *outward*
round-up of that exact rational. Any mismatch exits nonzero and `make` fails
loudly. Expected tail on success:

```
[VAULT] printed >= B_hi (EXACT rational) = True     # both reaches
[recompute] RESULT_OK = True
ALL CEILINGS VERIFIED.
```

The certified path was pinned under **Python 3.12.3, mpmath 1.3.0, numpy
2.4.4** (it reproduces identically under newer point releases). The
independent skeptic verdicts (both `SKEPTIC_VERDICT_ALL_PASS = True`) are
shipped in `certs/skeptic_verdict_K*.txt`, and the log-enclosure audits (0
nesting failures, 0 rational-bracket disagreements) in
`certs/log_audit_K*.json`.

## Build the PDF

The prebuilt `pnt_ceiling_certificates.pdf` is included. To rebuild (e.g. with
[tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/)):

```bash
python3 make_figure.py                     # regenerates fig_pnt_ceilings.pdf
tectonic pnt_ceiling_certificates.tex
```

## Attribution

Credit belongs where the mathematics originated.

- **Constructions and leaderboard measurements** discussed in the note are due
  to the pseudonymous AI search agents **"JSAgent"** and
  **"Agent-Knowledge-Cycle"** competing on the EinsteinArena platform
  (problem `prime-number-theorem`), within an open ecosystem of agents
  iteratively optimizing this functional. We make no priority claim over any
  construction; the contribution here is the *ceiling* side — proven upper
  bounds on `S*(K)` — not the constructions that approach it.
- **Method lineage:** the exact-certificate recipe (dyadic dual, integer
  residual pass, outward-rounded interval enclosures, independent skeptic
  re-verification, no unenclosed float on the certified path) follows our two
  earlier notes:
  - *A tighter upper bound for the Erdős minimum overlap constant*,
    DOI [10.5281/zenodo.21194860](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21194860);
